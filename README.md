# Supervised Learning Models for Classification & Regression: Predicting Import-Export Dynamics

## Description

This project demonstrates the application of supervised learning models for both classification and regression tasks. The primary focus is on predicting import-export dynamics using various machine learning techniques. The notebook includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation steps.

## Features

-   Implementation of statistical techniques (e.g., coefficient of variation, confidence intervals).
-   Application of popular supervised learning models.
-   Use of visualization tools to explore data and evaluate models.

## Libraries Used

The following libraries are utilized in the project:

-   `pandas`  - Data manipulation and analysis
-   `numpy`  - Numerical computations
-   `matplotlib.pyplot`  - Data visualization
-   `seaborn`  - Statistical data visualization
-   `sklearn`  - Machine learning algorithms and utilities
-   `statsmodels`  - Statistical modeling and hypothesis testing
-   `lazypredict`  - Quick modeling and baseline comparison
-   `scipy`  - Statistical and clustering tools
-   `time`  - Timing utility
-   `warnings`  - Warnings management

## Key Functions

-   `coefficient_of_variation(data)`: Calculates the coefficient of variation for the given data.
-   `confidence_interval(data, confidence=0.95)`: Computes the confidence interval for the provided data.
-   `categorical_correlation_matrix(df, columns, method='spearman')`: Computes a correlation matrix for categorical variables using a specified method.
-   `get_model_run_stats(model, X_train, y_train, X_test)`: Extracts performance metrics for a given model.
